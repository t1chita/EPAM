## ðŸ§  Swift Part 1 â€” Core Concepts

This module provides a solid foundation in Swift programming with a focus on safe, expressive, and modular code.

### ðŸ“Œ Topics:
- Constants (`let`) and variables (`var`)
- Type annotations and type inference
- Arithmetic and logical operators
- Strings and characters
- Collections: Arrays, Sets, Dictionaries
- Conditional statements and loops (`if`, `switch`, `while`, `repeat-while`, `for`)
- Functions with parameters and return values
- Closures and value capturing
- Enumerations with raw and associated values
